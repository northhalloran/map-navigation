Map Navigation - a Google Maps navigational aid
===============================================

`MapNavigation` is a class that allows to you to unobtrusively create a Google
Maps interface from existing navigational items in an HTML document. Given a
list of links containing hidden geographic data, it will insert a map into the
page that provides an alternate way of browsing the list by loading the links'
targets into the page using Ajax.
